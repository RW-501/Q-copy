Certainly! Here's an updated version where the chat bot fills in the placeholders after reading the writing:

"Please format the JSON to match the following structure:

rewrite in JSON minified format
Add the quiz information for the specific quiz:
'quizCode': [quiz_code_placeholder]
'quizName': [quiz_name_placeholder]
'numberOfQuestions': [number_of_questions_placeholder]
Include the 'questions' array with the respective question objects, each containing:
'question': The question text
'options': The array of options
'questionNumber': question Number
'difficulty': The difficulty level of the question (to be added for each question)
Ensure that the JSON structure is properly nested and formatted."
After reading the writing, the chat bot will fill in the placeholders with the appropriate values. For example:

[quiz_code_placeholder] might be replaced with "QZ001"
[quiz_name_placeholder] might be replaced with "Construction and Architecture Quiz"
[number_of_questions_placeholder] might be replaced with 13

"Please ensure that the JSON is written in a minified format without any line breaks or word wrapping. I prefer a compact representation without unnecessary whitespace."

The format of placing the JSON structure on a single line without any line breaks or word wrapping is commonly referred to as "minified" or "compressed" JSON. It is a compact representation of the JSON data that aims to reduce whitespace and line breaks, resulting in a more condensed form. Minified JSON is often used in scenarios where space is limited or network transmission efficiency is crucial.
