      "questionNumber": 1,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a VPN in network security?",
      "options": [
        "To protect against malware attacks",
        "To control and monitor network traffic",
        "To provide physical security to network devices",

      ],
      "answer": "To provide secure remote access to network resources",
      "explanation": "A VPN, or virtual private network, allows users to securely access a private network from a remote location. It encrypts data transmissions and provides a secure connection, making it a valuable tool for remote workers, telecommuters, and businesses with multiple locations.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 2,
      "question": "What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?",
      "options": [
        "Symmetric encryption uses two keys, while asymmetric encryption uses only one key",
        "Symmetric encryption uses a single key, while asymmetric encryption uses a public and private key pair",
        "Symmetric encryption is faster than asymmetric encryption",
        "Asymmetric encryption is only used for digital signatures"
      ],
      "answer": "Symmetric encryption uses a single key, while asymmetric encryption uses a public and private key pair",
      "explanation": "Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt it. Asymmetric encryption is more secure but slower than symmetric encryption.",
      "difficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 3,

        "A firewall rule that blocks traffic"
      ],
      "answer": "A network segment that is exposed to the internet",
      "explanation": "A DMZ, or demilitarized zone, is a network segment that is isolated from the internal network and is exposed to the internet. It is used to provide a layer of security between the internet and internal resources, such as web servers, that need to be accessible from the internet.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {

        "To provide remote access to network resources"
      ],
      "answer": "To identify network attacks in progress",
      "explanation": "A network intrusion detection system, or NIDS, is a network security tool that monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity. It alerts security personnel when it detects suspicious network behavior, allowing them to take action to prevent or mitigate attacks.",
      "difficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 5,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a honeypot in network security?",
      "options": [
        "To attract and monitor malicious activity",
        "To authenticate users before granting access",
        "To filter and block unwanted network traffic",
        "To ensure high availability of network resources"
      ],
      "answer": "To attract and monitor malicious activity",
      "explanation": "A honeypot is a decoy system designed to attract potential attackers and monitor their behavior. The purpose of a honeypot is to gather information about attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve network security defenses.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 6,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a NIDS in network security?",
      "options": [
        "To authenticate users before granting access",
        "To monitor and control network traffic",
        "To encrypt data transmissions over the internet",
        "To detect and alert on network-based attacks"
      ],
      "answer": "To detect and alert on network-based attacks",
      "explanation": "A network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) is a security technology that monitors network traffic to detect and alert on potential attacks. The purpose of a NIDS is to identify malicious activity in real-time and provide early warning to security teams to prevent or mitigate the impact of an attack.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 7,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a firewall rule in network security?",
      "options": [
        "To authenticate users before granting access",
        "To filter and block unwanted network traffic",
        "To encrypt data transmissions over the internet",
        "To ensure high availability of network resources"
      ],
      "answer": "To filter and block unwanted network traffic",
      "explanation": "A firewall rule is a security policy that defines what network traffic is allowed or blocked by a firewall. The purpose of a firewall rule is to filter and block unwanted network traffic based on a set of predefined criteria to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the attack surface of a network.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },

        "To cache and improve performance of internet requests"
      ],
      "answer": "To filter and block malicious websites and content",
      "explanation": "A proxy server is a network security mechanism that acts as an intermediary between clients and servers to filter and block malicious websites and content. The primary purpose of a proxy server is to provide an additional layer of security by blocking access to known malicious websites and preventing malicious content from entering a network.",
      "difficulty": "Easy"

    {
      "questionNumber": 9,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a honeypot in network security?",
      "options": [
        "To attract and trap attackers to gather intelligence about their methods and motives",
        "To encrypt data transmissions between network devices",
        "To monitor and control network traffic",
        "To provide physical security to network devices"
      ],
      "answer": "To attract and trap attackers to gather intelligence about their methods and motives",
      "explanation": "A honeypot is a decoy system or network that is designed to attract and trap attackers to gather intelligence about their methods and motives. Honeypots can be used to detect and analyze new and unknown threats, as well as to divert attackers' attention from the real target.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between a denial-of-service (DoS) attack and a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack?",
      "options": [
        "A DoS attack is launched from a single source, while a DDoS attack is launched from multiple sources",
"A DoS attack targets specific individuals or organizations, while a DDoS attack targets multiple organizations at once",
"A DoS attack is less damaging than a DDoS attack",
"A DDoS attack is easier to detect and mitigate than a DoS attack"
],
"answer": "A DoS attack is launched from a single source, while a DDoS attack is launched from multiple sources",
"explanation": "A DoS attack is a type of cyberattack that aims to disrupt or disable a target system or network by overwhelming it with traffic from a single source. A DDoS attack is a more sophisticated version of a DoS attack, in which multiple compromised systems are used to flood the target network with traffic, making it much harder to defend against.",
